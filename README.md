# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```


cd into cnotracts --> npx hardhat compile

To run the smart contract script:
node .\scripts\smartcontractconnect.js


Deploying contract command:
npx hardhat run .\scripts\deploy.js --network localhost


in version 6.6.2 ==> we were able to deploy
now in version 5.7.2 ==> we can test
